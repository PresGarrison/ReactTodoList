# React Todo List

I've recently been trying to learn react on Udemy. I wanted to try and see if I could create a project in which I used state to make a todo list. I haven't styled anything. Creating the logic behind my idea for the delete button is proving difficult, so I thought I'd upload the initial part of the project. Will probably stylize this later as well.
